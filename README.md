programs for error functions

Thank you for checking my programs.

Programs in this repository are made to calculate error functions with guaranteed accuracy.

If you use my programs in publications, please include the following reference.

Daisuke Kanaizumi, Verified numerical computation methods for q-special functions and q-series, Bachelor thesis, Department of Applied Mathematics, Waseda University (Japanese document)

You do NOT have to inform your usage to me, but I am very glad to hear how my programs helped you.

I have a plan to translate my thesis in English, but this may take more time. I apologize for the inconvenience.

(Requirements)

Before using my C++ programs, please install these libraries.

kv library -a C++ library for verified numerical computation

Boost C++ Libraries http://www.boost.org/

DISCLAIMER: Extensive tests have been performed to ensure reliability of the algorithms (under Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015, and Linux). However, neither an error-free processor nor an error-free program can be guaranteed.
